{"ttl":"A11(AISI)","msg":"Highly wear resistant tool steel. Not tough enough to be used in large blades, but for small knives or folders it is an excellent choice, especially when high abrasive resistance is desired, e.g. lots of cardboard to cut. High working hardness 64-65HRC. Used by few custom makers, so far I have not seen production knife using it. Phil Wilson works a lot with Crucible's version of A11 - <a href=\"\/knives\/steels\/cpm_10v.shtml\">CPM 10V steel<\/a>, I've seen Farid's work using the same alloy as well."}
